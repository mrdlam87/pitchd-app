# Decision Log

> Newest first. Each entry: decision, why, and what would make us revisit it.

## 2026-11-09 — The agent is the focal point of Pitchd
- **Why:** The real value is deciding where to go and keeping the plan right, not just searching. An agent can compare, explain trade-offs, and follow the trip over time.
- **Revisit if:** Founder's own trips show the map-first search is faster for most cases.

## 2026-11-09 — Python agent service, Next.js frontend kept
- **Why:** Python has the largest body of agent examples, courses and eval tooling — good for the learning goal — and the skills transfer to other AI work. Next.js/Vercel already handles auth, map and UI well.
- **Trade-off accepted:** Two languages and two deployments.
- **Revisit if:** The two-service overhead outweighs the learning value; a TypeScript agent inside Next.js is a viable alternative.

## 2026-11-09 — Build the agent loop by hand first, then adopt SDK helpers
- **Why:** Learning goal — understand the loop before abstracting it.

## 2026-11-09 — Start with one user, design for scale
- **Why:** The founder is the first real user (persona: Matt). Keep state out of the service process, log costs and tool calls, and add rate limits so scaling is a config change, not a rewrite.

## 2026-11-09 — Keep the current app live during the revamp
- **Why:** M1–M6 works and is deployed; the revamp is exploratory.
