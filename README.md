> Google Maps for Australian campers — everything you need for a trip, in one place.

---

## What is it?
CampFinder is a map-first web app that helps Australian campers find everything they need for a trip without jumping between multiple apps.

Search the map and instantly see:
- 🏕️ **Campsites** — free, paid, national parks, state parks
- 🚿 **Essential amenities** — dump points, public toilets, water fill stations, laundromats
- 🐕 **Activity filters** — dog-friendly, fishing, swimming, hiking trails nearby

Think Google Maps, but built specifically for camping life.

## Why does this exist?
Finding the right campsite — one that's dog-friendly, near a good fishing spot, and within range of a dump point — currently means bouncing between 2-3 different apps, none of which do all of it well. The most popular Australian app in this space (WikiCamp) has declined significantly following a 2024 redesign and commercial acquisition.

CampFinder is built to be the app that Australian campers actually want.
