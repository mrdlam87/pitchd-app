## The Problem
Planning a camping trip in Australia is surprisingly time-consuming and fragmented. A typical camper might spend hours across multiple apps and websites just to answer basic questions — where should I go this weekend? Will it be raining? Is there a dump point nearby? Can I bring my dog?

There is no single tool that brings this all together intelligently. And not one existing camping app uses AI.

## The Solution
Pitchd understands what you're looking for and does the research for you. Describe your trip in plain English, and Pitchd checks the weather, finds matching campsites, and displays everything on a map.

> *"Find me a campsite a few hours from Sydney this weekend where it's not raining"*
> *"Dog-friendly spot in the Blue Mountains with a dump point nearby"*
> *"Free campsite in Queensland near a good fishing spot"*

What used to take hours now takes seconds.

## What you can find
- 🏕️ **Campsites** — free, paid, national parks, state parks
- 🚿 **Essential amenities** — dump points, public toilets, water fill stations, laundromats
- 🐕 **Activity filters** — dog-friendly, fishing, swimming, hiking trails nearby
- ⛅ **Weather-aware search** — find somewhere dry without manually checking forecasts across multiple regions
- 🗺️ **Open in Google Maps** — one tap to get directions to any campsite or amenity

## Why AI?
Every other camping app is essentially a database with a search bar. You pick your filters and hope for the best. Pitchd is different — it understands what you're looking for, factors in real-time weather, and gives you intelligent results. Like asking a well-travelled mate who knows every campsite in the country.
