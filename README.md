# 🏕️ Pitchd
> The AI-powered camping companion for Australians.

---

## What is it?
Pitchd is an AI-powered web app that makes finding the perfect campsite as easy as having a conversation. Instead of juggling multiple apps and endless filter dropdowns, just describe what you want in plain English and Pitchd does the rest.

> *"Dog-friendly campsite within 3 hours of Melbourne near a good fishing spot"*
> *"Free campsite in Queensland with a dump point nearby"*
> *"Somewhere peaceful to pitch a tent this weekend with my kids"*

Pitchd interprets your request, finds the best matches, and displays them on an interactive map — along with everything else you need nearby.

## Why AI?
Every other camping app is essentially a database with a search bar. You already know what filters to apply, you just have to find them. Pitchd is different — it understands what you're looking for, the way a knowledgeable mate would.

This also means Pitchd is useful from day one, without needing years of community-built reviews to add value.

## What you can find
- 🏕️ **Campsites** — free, paid, national parks, state parks
- 🚿 **Essential amenities** — dump points, public toilets, water fill stations, laundromats
- 🐕 **Activity filters** — dog-friendly, fishing, swimming, hiking trails nearby

---

## Why does this exist?
The most popular Australian camping app has declined significantly following a 2024 redesign and commercial acquisition — and no existing app uses AI. Pitchd is built to fill that gap with something smarter, faster, and more useful.
